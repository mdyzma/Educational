About this Course
-----------------


Thank you for enrolling in Using Databases with Python. This course will introduce you to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort. The course will use SQLite3 as its database. We will also build web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes, and will use the D3.js library to do basic data visualization. This course will cover Chapters 14-15 of the book 'Python for Informatics'.


This is the last course within the Python for Everybody specialization. We hope that you are successful in this course and that we will see you in the Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python.
